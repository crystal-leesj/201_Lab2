    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I joined the military 2 years after high school because I knew then that college wasn't for me. I decided to join the Army after
    a few odd-ball jobs and realizing that I needed something more. I ended up serving 10 years as Communications Sergeant, mainly with Special Operations.
    After getting out, I worked as technical trainer for now, the L3 Harris Corporation. I then moved out here to Washington for school as I now knew it was my time. Long story short,
    I finished school and then found this program with Amazon and it was because of school that I found coding and so because I waited, I finally found something I really enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Employment</h3>
    <p>I have moved about 4 times in the past 6 years and finally getting ready to settle down.</p>
    
      <li>I have lived in Naples, Italy</li>
      <li>Miami,FL</li>
      <li>Southern Pines, NC</li>
      <li>Rochester, Ny</li>
      <li>Tacoma, WA</li>
      <li>Seattle, WA</li>
    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>I am an aspiring software developer as I love creating and tinkering with web pages and understanding how they work and how far you can 
    go with code. I love a challenge that pushes myself.</p>
